<h1>Captain Vikram Batra Famous as Shershah</h1>
<p>When Captain Vikram Batra said that his victory through radio from this peak was 'This heart mange More', he did not even mention the army but his name in the whole of India. At the same time Vikram's name was given as the name of Sher Shah as well as the name of 'Kargil Sher'.
